//Task 5: Create a nested object representing a library with properties like name and books (an array of book objects), and log the library object to the console.
const library = {
    name: "City Library",
    books: [
        { title: "The Alchemist", author: "Paulo Coelho", year: 1988 },
        { title: "The Alchemist", author: "Paulo Coelho", year: 2000 }
    ]
};

console.log(library);

//when an object contains another object as a property, it is called a nested object
